==============================

This dataset was exported via roboflow.ai on March 16, 2022 at 9:12 PM GMT

It includes 90 images.
Conocidos-familiares-peligro are annotated in folder format.

The following pre-processing was applied to each image:
* Auto-orientation of pixel data (with EXIF-orientation stripping)
* Resize to 64x64 (Stretch)
* Grayscale (CRT phosphor)
* Auto-contrast via adaptive equalization

The following augmentation was applied to create 3 versions of each source image:
* 50% probability of horizontal flip
* Equal probability of one of the following 90-degree rotations: none, clockwise, counter-clockwise
* Randomly crop between 0 and 20 percent of the image
* Random rotation of between -15 and +15 degrees
* Random shear of between -15째 to +15째 horizontally and -15째 to +15째 vertically
* Random brigthness adjustment of between -25 and +25 percent
* Random exposure adjustment of between -25 and +25 percent
* Random Gaussian blur of between 0 and 10 pixels
* Salt and pepper noise was applied to 5 percent of pixels
